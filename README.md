# Fully Automated Quality Control of Rigid & Affine Registrations of T1w and T2w MRI in big data using Diffusion Models

Welcome to the Quality Control of Brain MRI Registration repository! This project focuses on Quality control of brain MRI registrations using diffusion models. The repository contains Python files for reading MRI images, training diffusion models to generate images, compare to check quality and display results. Diffusion models are used to improve the accuracy compared to other  machine learning techniques since diffusion models are good at handling noisy images as well. 


## Repository Structure

- `read_nifti.py`: Python script for reading the MRI images.
- `final.py`: Python script for training diffusion models to generate correctly aligned registrations and then compare with the output image generated by software tools used for creating MRI registrations for quality control.
- `display.py`: Python script for displaying results.

## Getting Started
