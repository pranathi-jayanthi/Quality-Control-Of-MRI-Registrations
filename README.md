# Brain MRI Anomaly Detection

Welcome to the Brain MRI Anomaly Detection repository! This project focuses on detecting anomalies in brain MRI images using diffusion models. The repository contains Python files for displaying MRI images and training models to identify anomaly scans.

## About the Project

Brain MRI anomaly detection is crucial for diagnosing neurological disorders and abnormalities in brain structure. This project leverages stable diffusion techniques to analyze MRI scans and identify regions with anomalies, providing valuable insights for medical professionals and researchers.

The repository includes Python scripts for preprocessing MRI data, training deep learning models, and visualizing results. By combining advanced image processing techniques with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection in brain MRI scans.
